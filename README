poc_decimator
=============

This is the proof of concept (POC) for the JPEG2000 decimator for Lunar Numbat.

Basically, it takes JPEG2000 file and reduces it size very quickly. It does 
this by dropping quality and/or resolution layers. Because of the properties of
JPEG2000, this doesn't require the time and cpu expensive decompression and 
recompression.



Limitations
-----------

The current implementation only works with JPEG2000 files that are compressed
with the SOP option. The Start of Packet (SOP) marker is used to mark the start
of the packets for the various components, resolutions and quality layers that
make up the image data.
